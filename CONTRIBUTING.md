## Development Guidelines

### Code Style

#### Python
- Follow PEP 8 style guide
- Use meaningful variable and function names
- Add docstrings to all functions and classes
- Keep functions focused and small

#### MATLAB
- Use consistent indentation (4 spaces)
- Add comments for complex logic
- Use descriptive variable names

### Directory Structure

When adding new features:
- Educational/simple implementations go in `v1/`
- Research-grade implementations go in `v2/`
- Shared utilities go in `common/`
- Always include appropriate `__init__.py` files

### Testing

- Write tests for new features
- Ensure existing tests pass
- Aim for >80% code coverage
- Test with multiple data formats (if applicable)

### Documentation

- Update relevant README files
- Add docstrings to new functions
- Include usage examples
- Update CHANGELOG.md

## Version Guidelines

### v1 (Educational)
- Keep it simple and readable
- Minimize dependencies
- Focus on clarity over performance
- Include extensive comments

### v2 (Research-Grade)
- Follow object-oriented design principles
- Ensure extensibility
- Optimize for performance where needed
- Include comprehensive error handling

## Commit Messages

- Use present tense ("Add feature" not "Added feature")
- Keep the first line under 50 characters
- Reference issues and pull requests when relevant
- Be descriptive but concise

Example:
```
Add wavelet-based spike detection

- Implement continuous wavelet transform method
- Add configuration options for wavelet parameters
- Include unit tests and documentation
- Fixes #123
```

## Review Process

1. All submissions require review
2. Changes may be requested for:
   - Code style consistency
   - Test coverage
   - Documentation completeness
   - Performance concerns
3. Be patient and constructive during review
